Well, ` welcome ` to ` soteriology ` this ` course ` deals ` with ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` and ` the ` doctrine ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit, ` how ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` works ` in ` the ` soul. ` Running ` all ` the ` way ` from ` his ` effectual ` calling ` and ` regeneration ` all ` the ` way ` to ` glorification. ` So ` it's ` a ` very ` important ` subject ` and ` I'm ` glad ` you're ` with ` me.

We're ` going ` to ` look ` at ` it ` in ` some ` detail. ` I ` think ` you'll ` enjoy ` the ` class. ` After ` all, ` all ` of ` our ` Christianity, ` all ` of ` our ` personal ` religion ` is ` just ` a ` sham ` without ` the ` Holy ` Spirit. ` So ` we're ` very, ` very ` grateful ` for ` the ` ministry ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit, ` I ` want ` to ` begin ` this

first ` lecture ` with ` the ` reading ` of ` God's ` word, ` as ` we ` will ` with ` each ` each ` lecture. ` Turn ` with ` me, ` please, ` to ` Romans ` 8 ` and ` I'll ` read ` 13 ` through ` 17. ` Romans ` 8: ` 13 ` through ` 17.

For, ` if ` you ` live ` after ` the ` flesh, ` you ` shall ` die. ` But ` if ` ye ` through ` the ` Spirit ` do ` mortify, ` the ` deeds ` of ` the ` body ` ye ` shall ` live. ` For ` as ` many ` as ` are ` led ` by ` the ` Spirit ` of ` God, ` they ` are ` the ` sons ` of ` God. ` For ` you ` have ` not ` received ` the ` Spirit ` of ` bondage ` again ` to ` fear, ` but ` you ` have ` received ` the ` Spirit ` of ` adoption ` whereby ` we ` cry ` Abba, ` Father

The ` Spirit ` itself ` beareth ` witness ` with ` our ` spirit ` that ` we ` are ` the ` children ` of ` God ` and ` if ` children ` then ` heirs, ` heirs ` of ` God ` and ` joint ` heirs ` with ` Christ. ` If ` so ` be ` that ` we ` suffer ` with ` him, ` that ` we ` may ` also ` be ` glorified ` together.

Let's ` seek ` God's ` face ` in ` prayer.

Lord ` God, ` we ` stand ` on ` holy ` ground ` as ` we ` approach ` this ` immense ` subject ` of ` the ` third ` person ` of ` the ` Holy ` Trinity

and ` his ` salvific ` work ` in ` our ` souls.

And ` we ` do ` pray ` that ` by ` the ` end ` of ` this ` course, ` we ` will ` have ` a ` much ` more ` profound ` appreciation ` for ` the ` saving ` ministry ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit, ` than ` we ` perhaps ` might ` have ` at ` present

Help ` us ` to ` grow, ` not ` only ` in ` the ` grace ` and ` knowledge ` of ` Jesus, ` whom ` the ` Spirit ` focuses ` upon, ` but ` also ` that ` we ` would ` grow ` in ` the ` grace ` and ` knowledge ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit, ` becoming ` more ` aware ` of ` His ` work, ` His ` saving ` work, ` and ` appreciating ` more ` profoundly ` the ` vastness ` of ` His ` ministry

as ` he ` works ` in ` sinners ` and ` rebels, ` such ` as ` we ` all ` are ` by ` nature.

So ` Lord ` bless ` this ` class. ` Help ` me ` in ` teaching. ` Help ` the ` students ` in ` listening, ` learning, ` and ` grant ` that ` each ` lecture ` may ` serve ` to ` thy ` glory, ` to ` our ` spiritual ` growth, ` and ` to ` the ` well-being ` of ` our ` entire ` being ` as ` we ` journey ` to ` the ` never-ending ` eternity.

Be ` with ` us ` now ` we ` pray. ` In ` Jesus ` name.

Amen.

Well, ` thank ` you ` for ` joining ` us ` for ` this ` class ` and ` I ` want ` to ` begin ` with ` the ` first ` lecture, ` which ` is ` titled: ` The ` Study ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit. ` The ` Study ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit. ` God's ` Holy ` spirit ` was ` with ` God's ` people ` from ` the ` beginning.

Already in ` Genesis ` 1, ` verse ` 2 ` leading ` them ` ultimately ` to ` their ` rest ` in ` Jesus ` Christ ` (Isaiah ` 63 ` 14)

To ` know ` the ` Spirit ` therefore ` is ` to ` stand ` in ` continuity ` with ` the ` Saints ` of ` all ` ages.

God ` has ` promised, ` his ` Spirit ` al`ready ` to ` Israel,

His ` chosen ` people. ` We ` know ` that ` in ` the ` Old ` Testament, ` various ` individuals ` experience ` a ` comfort ` of ` that ` Spirit. ` Think ` of ` David, ` for ` example ` (Psalm ` 51) ` But ` God ` promised

a ` far ` richer ` and ` broader ` work ` of ` the ` Spirit ` than ` we ` might ` possibly ` imagine. ` Isaiah ` foretold ` of ` a ` righteous ` king ` whose ` administration ` would ` be ` like, ` rivers ` of ` water`s ` in ` a ` dry ` place ` and ` the ` transformation ` of ` the ` barren ` wilderness ` into ` a ` world ` filled ` with ` the ` fruit ` of ` righteousness ` (Isaiah ` 32). ` When ` the ` Spirit,

When ` the ` Spirit ` is ` poured ` out ` upon ` us ` from ` on ` high.

And ` then ` he ` goes ` on ` to ` say ` in ` Isaiah ` 44, ` that ` the ` Spirit ` would ` be ` poured ` out ` on ` Is`rael, ` like ` a ` river ` of ` water ` on ` dry ` ground, ` irrigating ` faithless ` souls ` to ` produce ` a ` people ` who ` say ` I ` am ` the ` Lord's.

And ` so ` the ` Spirit ` is ` the ` answer ` of ` God's ` covenant`al ` faithfulness

to ` the ` chronic ` problem ` of ` Israel's ` covenant ` breaking.

You ` find ` that ` also ` in ` the ` Book ` of ` Joel ` that ` the ` Lord ` would ` pour ` out ` his ` Spirit ` upon ` all ` his ` people ` that ` whosoever ` would ` call ` on ` the ` name ` of ` the ` Lord ` would ` be ` saved ` (Joel ` 2:28 ` to ` 32). ` So ` to ` study ` the ` work ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` is ` to ` study ` heavenly ` work, ` saving ` work.

And ` work ` that ` abides ` forever.

Now, ` of ` course, ` in ` the ` New ` Testament ` age ` you ` know, ` that ` when ` Jesus ` rose ` from ` the ` dead ` and ` ascended ` into ` heaven,

He ` poured ` out ` His ` Spirit ` in ` much ` larger ` measures ` than ` had ` previously ` been ` known ` (Acts ` 2 ` 17, ` through ` 21 ` and ` 33 ` and ` 34)

And ` Peter ` after ` his ` sermon ` is ` interrupted ` by ` thousands ` of ` people ` who ` are ` under ` great ` conviction ` of ` sin. ` Under ` it

and ` they ` cried ` out ` men ` and ` Brethren. ` What ` shall ` we ` do?

Peter ` said ` to ` them, ` repent ` and ` be ` baptized ` everyone ` of ` you ` in ` the ` name ` of ` Jesus ` Christ. ` And ` you ` shall ` receive ` the ` gift ` of ` the ` Holy ` Ghost.

For ` the ` promise ` is ` unto ` you ` and ` to ` your ` children ` and ` to ` all ` that ` are ` afar ` off. ` Even ` as ` many ` as ` the ` Lord, ` Our ` God ` shall ` call ` (Acts ` 2: ` 38 ` and ` 39). ` And ` so ` the ` rest ` of ` the ` New ` Testament ` writings, ` particularly ` Paul's ` Epistles, ` are ` just ` filled ` with ` the ` Holy ` Spirit. ` He ` speaks ` often ` about ` being ` born ` of ` the ` Spirit ` such ` as ` Galatians, ` 4: ` 29.

And ` he's ` talking ` constantly ` about ` different ` aspects ` of ` the ` Spirit's ` saving ` work. ` Like ` we ` just ` read ` a ` few ` of ` them ` to ` you ` from ` from ` Romans ` 8.

So ` if ` we ` treasure ` Christ ` as ` our ` only ` mediator, ` we ` will ` also ` treasure ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` as ` Christ's ` great ` gift, ` which ` is ` inseparable ` from ` Him, ` to ` sinners ` (John ` 4 ` and ` again ` John ` 7).

Jonathan ` Edwards ` put ` it ` this ` way. ` "The ` sum ` of ` the ` blessings ` Christ ` sought ` by ` what ` he ` did ` and ` suffered ` in ` the ` work ` of ` redemption, ` was ` the ` Holy ` Spirit, ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` in ` His ` indwelling, ` His ` influences ` and ` fruits ` is ` the ` sum ` of ` all ` grace, ` holiness, ` comfort ` and ` joy, ` or ` in ` one ` word ` of ` all ` the ` spiritual ` good ` Christ ` purchased ` for ` men ` in ` this ` world.

And ` is ` also ` the ` sum ` of ` all ` perfection, ` glory, ` and ` eternal ` joy, ` that ` he ` purchased ` for ` them ` in ` another ` world."

That's ` an ` amazing ` quote ` by ` Edwards. ` And ` it ` certainly ` shows ` us ` that ` many ` today ` are ` minimizing ` the ` role ` of ` the ` ministry ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` as

integral ` with ` the ` entire ` sum ` of ` blessings ` that ` God's ` people ` receive ` in ` salvation.

John ` Brown ` of ` Headington ` put ` it ` this ` way, ` "Did ` Christ ` purchase ` the ` Holy ` Spirit?

Christ ` purchased ` the ` Spirit's ` gifts, ` and ` influences ` in ` applying ` redemption, ` but ` not ` his ` being, ` which ` is ` independent."

So ` the ` work ` of ` the ` Spirit

in ` many ` ways ` is ` the ` fruit ` of ` Christ's ` death ` and ` resurrection.

Now, ` salvation ` in ` Christ ` is ` appreciated ` and ` enjoyed ` therefore ` only ` by ` knowing ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` and ` his ` saving ` work. ` And ` this ` is ` one ` of ` the ` greatest ` doctrines ` of ` the ` Reformation, ` developed ` so ` thoroughly ` and ` then ` even ` augmented ` by ` the ` Puritans. ` What ` a ` treasure ` Reformed ` theology ` brings ` us

about ` the ` saving ` ministry ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit.

In ` fact, ` BB ` Warfield ` called ` John ` Calvin ` The ` Theologian ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit. ` And ` Warfield ` went ` on ` to ` claim ` the ` developed ` doctrine ` of ` the ` work ` of ` the ` Holy ` Spirit ` is ` an ` exclusively ` Reformation ` doctrine, ` and ` more ` particularly ` a ` Reformed ` doctrine, ` and ` still ` more ` particularly ` a ` Puritan ` doctrine.

And ` so, ` study ` of ` the ` Spirit

through ` Reformed ` experiential ` soteriology, ` - that ` is, ` salvation ` that ` we ` experience ` by ` the ` work ` of ` the ` Spirit ` in ` the ` soul - ` opens ` up ` a ` vast ` wealth ` of ` wisdom ` and ` joy ` to ` the ` believer.
