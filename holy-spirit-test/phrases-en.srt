1
0:0:1,200 --> 0:0:1,400
Well,

2
0:0:1,400 --> 0:0:3,600
welcome to soteriology.

3
0:0:4,200 --> 0:0:8,200
This course deals with the Holy Spirit

4
0:0:8,800 --> 0:0:11,500
and the doctrine of the Holy Spirit,

5
0:0:11,500 --> 0:0:13,700
how the Holy Spirit works in the soul.

6
0:0:14,0 --> 0:0:17,700
Running all the way from His effectual calling,

7
0:0:18,200 --> 0:0:19,400
and regeneration,

8
0:0:19,900 --> 0:0:21,900
all the way to glorification.

9
0:0:22,400 --> 0:0:26,100
So it's a very important subject

10
0:0:26,700 --> 0:0:28,900
and I'm glad you're with me.

11
0:0:30,0 --> 0:0:32,800
We're going to look at it in some detail.

12
0:0:33,700 --> 0:0:35,700
I think you'll enjoy the class.

13
0:0:36,500 --> 0:0:37,300
After all,

14
0:0:37,300 --> 0:0:38,100
all of our

15
0:0:40,500 --> 0:0:41,500
Christianity,

16
0:0:41,500 --> 0:0:43,500
all of our personal religion

17
0:0:43,500 --> 0:0:46,0
is just a sham without the Holy Spirit.

18
0:0:46,0 --> 0:0:47,900
So we're very,

19
0:0:47,900 --> 0:0:51,600
very grateful for the ministry of the Holy Spirit,

20
0:0:52,800 --> 0:0:54,400
I want to begin this

21
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:58,900
first lecture with the reading of God's word,

22
0:0:59,600 --> 0:1:1,800
as we will with each each lecture.

23
0:1:2,300 --> 0:1:2,900
Turn with me,

24
0:1:2,900 --> 0:1:3,300
please,

25
0:1:3,300 --> 0:1:8,400
to Romans 8 and I'll read 13 through 17.

26
0:1:8,400 --> 0:1:10,600
Romans 8: 13 through 17.

27
0:1:12,300 --> 0:1:12,400
For,

28
0:1:12,400 --> 0:1:14,400
if you live after the flesh,

29
0:1:15,0 --> 0:1:16,0
you shall die.

30
0:1:16,500 --> 0:1:17,100
But if ye

31
0:1:17,100 --> 0:1:18,800
through the Spirit do mortify,

32
0:1:18,800 --> 0:1:20,0
the deeds of the body

33
0:1:21,300 --> 0:1:22,300
ye shall live.

34
0:1:23,300 --> 0:1:24,700
For as many as are led

35
0:1:24,700 --> 0:1:26,100
by the Spirit of God,

36
0:1:26,600 --> 0:1:28,0
they are the sons of God.

37
0:1:28,700 --> 0:1:30,300
For you have not received the Spirit

38
0:1:30,300 --> 0:1:32,500
of bondage again to fear,

39
0:1:33,100 --> 0:1:35,500
but you have received the Spirit of adoption

40
0:1:35,900 --> 0:1:38,400
whereby we cry Abba,

41
0:1:38,600 --> 0:1:39,300
Father.

42
0:1:40,100 --> 0:1:42,900
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit

43
0:1:43,200 --> 0:1:44,900
that we are the children of God,

44
0:1:45,700 --> 0:1:48,100
and if children then heirs,

45
0:1:48,300 --> 0:1:51,0
heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.

46
0:1:51,700 --> 0:1:52,700
If so be

47
0:1:53,0 --> 0:1:54,800
that we suffer with him,

48
0:1:55,200 --> 0:1:59,800
that we may also be glorified together.

49
0:2:1,300 --> 0:2:3,100
Let's seek God's face in prayer.

50
0:2:6,600 --> 0:2:7,300
Lord God,

51
0:2:7,300 --> 0:2:10,0
we stand on holy ground,

52
0:2:10,0 --> 0:2:12,600
as we approach this

53
0:2:13,100 --> 0:2:18,0
immense subject of the third person of the Holy Trinity

54
0:2:19,500 --> 0:2:24,0
and his salvific work in our souls.

55
0:2:25,0 --> 0:2:26,400
And we do pray that

56
0:2:26,900 --> 0:2:28,100
by the end of this course,

57
0:2:28,100 --> 0:2:31,400
we will have a much more profound appreciation

58
0:2:32,600 --> 0:2:35,0
for the saving ministry of the Holy Spirit,

59
0:2:36,0 --> 0:2:38,400
than we perhaps might have at present

60
0:2:39,400 --> 0:2:40,500
Help us to grow,

61
0:2:40,800 --> 0:2:43,400
not only in the grace and knowledge of Jesus,

62
0:2:44,600 --> 0:2:46,500
whom the Spirit focuses upon,

63
0:2:47,500 --> 0:2:49,100
but also that we would grow

64
0:2:49,800 --> 0:2:52,100
in the grace and knowledge of the Holy Spirit,

65
0:2:53,300 --> 0:2:55,500
becoming more aware of His work,

66
0:2:56,100 --> 0:2:57,300
His saving work,

67
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:0,0
and appreciating more profoundly

68
0:3:0,100 --> 0:3:1,900
the vastness of His ministry

69
0:3:3,200 --> 0:3:5,600
as he works in sinners and rebels,

70
0:3:6,100 --> 0:3:8,0
such as we all are by nature.

71
0:3:9,200 --> 0:3:10,800
So Lord bless this class.

72
0:3:11,400 --> 0:3:12,300
Help me in teaching.

73
0:3:12,300 --> 0:3:13,900
Help the students in listening,

74
0:3:14,700 --> 0:3:15,400
learning,

75
0:3:16,300 --> 0:3:20,400
and grant that each lecture

76
0:3:21,200 --> 0:3:22,900
may serve to thy glory,

77
0:3:23,800 --> 0:3:25,300
to our spiritual growth,

78
0:3:26,200 --> 0:3:27,700
and to the well-being

79
0:3:28,700 --> 0:3:32,500
of our entire being as we journey

80
0:3:33,300 --> 0:3:35,400
to the never-ending eternity.

81
0:3:36,200 --> 0:3:37,500
Be with us now we pray.

82
0:3:37,500 --> 0:3:38,400
In Jesus name.

83
0:3:39,500 --> 0:3:40,100
Amen.

84
0:3:43,500 --> 0:3:43,800
Well,

85
0:3:43,800 --> 0:3:46,300
thank you for joining us for this class

86
0:3:46,400 --> 0:3:47,800
and I want to

87
0:3:48,500 --> 0:3:51,300
begin with the first lecture,

88
0:3:51,300 --> 0:3:53,200
which is titled: The Study

89
0:3:53,900 --> 0:3:55,100
of the Holy Spirit.

90
0:3:55,100 --> 0:3:58,900
The Study of the Holy Spirit.

91
0:4:1,0 --> 0:4:6,200
God's Holy spirit was with God's people from the beginning.

92
0:4:7,400 --> 0:4:9,900
Already in Genesis 1,

93
0:4:9,900 --> 0:4:10,600
verse 2

94
0:4:12,300 --> 0:4:16,399
leading them ultimately to their rest

95
0:4:17,300 --> 0:4:22,900
in Jesus Christ (Isaiah 63 14)

96
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:26,300
To know the Spirit

97
0:4:27,100 --> 0:4:30,700
therefore is to stand in continuity

98
0:4:31,900 --> 0:4:33,500
with the Saints of all ages.

99
0:4:35,800 --> 0:4:37,0
God has promised,

100
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:38,900
his Spirit already to Israel,

101
0:4:40,400 --> 0:4:41,600
His chosen people.

102
0:4:42,900 --> 0:4:44,700
We know that in the Old Testament,

103
0:4:44,700 --> 0:4:48,900
various individuals experience a comfort of that Spirit.

104
0:4:48,900 --> 0:4:49,600
Think of David,

105
0:4:49,600 --> 0:4:51,600
for example (Psalm 51)

106
0:4:54,0 --> 0:4:55,400
But God promised

107
0:4:56,600 --> 0:5:1,0
a far richer and broader work of the Spirit

108
0:5:1,800 --> 0:5:4,500
than we might possibly imagine.

109
0:5:5,900 --> 0:5:9,200
Isaiah foretold of a righteous king

110
0:5:9,700 --> 0:5:11,400
whose administration would be like,

111
0:5:11,600 --> 0:5:14,0
rivers of waters in a dry place

112
0:5:14,400 --> 0:5:17,500
and the transformation of the barren wilderness

113
0:5:17,900 --> 0:5:23,400
into a world filled with the fruit of righteousness (Isaiah 32).

114
0:5:24,200 --> 0:5:25,800
When the Spirit,

115
0:5:26,400 --> 0:5:28,0
When the Spirit

116
0:5:28,500 --> 0:5:32,500
is poured out upon us from on high.

117
0:5:34,700 --> 0:5:37,100
And then he goes on to say in Isaiah 44,

118
0:5:37,700 --> 0:5:39,500
that the Spirit would be poured out on Israel,

119
0:5:39,500 --> 0:5:40,100
like a river

120
0:5:40,100 --> 0:5:41,700
of water on dry ground,

121
0:5:41,900 --> 0:5:47,0
irrigating faithless souls to produce a people

122
0:5:47,300 --> 0:5:51,200
who say I am the Lord's.

123
0:5:52,600 --> 0:5:53,900
And so the Spirit

124
0:5:54,800 --> 0:5:58,600
is the answer of God's covenantal faithfulness

125
0:5:59,800 --> 0:6:2,300
to the chronic problem

126
0:6:2,700 --> 0:6:4,800
of Israel's covenant breaking.

127
0:6:6,100 --> 0:6:7,200
You find that also in

128
0:6:7,700 --> 0:6:8,700
the Book of Joel

129
0:6:9,100 --> 0:6:12,500
that the Lord would pour out his Spirit upon all his people

130
0:6:13,200 --> 0:6:15,300
that whosoever would call on the name

131
0:6:15,300 --> 0:6:18,0
of the Lord would be saved

132
0:6:18,800 --> 0:6:21,200
(Joel 2:28 to 32).

133
0:6:22,300 --> 0:6:24,900
So to study the work of the Holy Spirit

134
0:6:26,100 --> 0:6:28,800
is to study heavenly work,

135
0:6:29,500 --> 0:6:30,600
saving work.

136
0:6:31,800 --> 0:6:35,100
And work that abides forever.

137
0:6:36,900 --> 0:6:37,0
Now,

138
0:6:37,0 --> 0:6:37,500
of course,

139
0:6:37,500 --> 0:6:40,100
in the New Testament age you know,

140
0:6:40,100 --> 0:6:42,400
that when Jesus rose from the dead

141
0:6:43,100 --> 0:6:44,300
and ascended into heaven,

142
0:6:45,900 --> 0:6:48,400
He poured out His Spirit

143
0:6:49,100 --> 0:6:52,100
in much larger measures than

144
0:6:53,100 --> 0:6:54,600
had previously been known

145
0:6:55,800 --> 0:6:58,0
(Acts 2 17,

146
0:6:58,0 --> 0:7:2,200
through 21 and 33 and 34)

147
0:7:4,0 --> 0:7:8,100
And Peter after his sermon is interrupted by

148
0:7:8,600 --> 0:7:11,300
thousands of people who are under great conviction of sin.

149
0:7:11,300 --> 0:7:12,200
Under it

150
0:7:13,400 --> 0:7:15,200
and they cried out men and Brethren.

151
0:7:15,200 --> 0:7:16,400
What shall we do?

152
0:7:17,700 --> 0:7:18,800
Peter said to them,

153
0:7:18,800 --> 0:7:21,500
repent and be baptized everyone of you

154
0:7:21,800 --> 0:7:23,600
in the name of Jesus Christ.

155
0:7:24,100 --> 0:7:28,600
And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

156
0:7:29,600 --> 0:7:31,100
For the promise is unto you

157
0:7:31,500 --> 0:7:32,600
and to your children

158
0:7:32,700 --> 0:7:34,500
and to all that are afar off.

159
0:7:34,700 --> 0:7:36,100
Even as many as the Lord,

160
0:7:36,100 --> 0:7:40,0
Our God shall call (Acts 2: 38 and 39).

161
0:7:42,700 --> 0:7:44,600
And so the rest

162
0:7:44,600 --> 0:7:45,900
of the New Testament writings,

163
0:7:45,900 --> 0:7:47,500
particularly Paul's Epistles,

164
0:7:47,800 --> 0:7:52,100
are just filled with the Holy Spirit.

165
0:7:52,900 --> 0:7:53,900
He speaks often

166
0:7:53,900 --> 0:7:54,900
about being born

167
0:7:54,900 --> 0:7:57,200
of the Spirit such as Galatians,

168
0:7:57,200 --> 0:7:59,0
4: 29.

169
0:7:59,300 --> 0:8:1,600
And he's talking constantly

170
0:8:1,700 --> 0:8:3,200
about different aspects

171
0:8:3,200 --> 0:8:4,900
of the Spirit's saving work.

172
0:8:5,100 --> 0:8:6,100
Like we just read a few

173
0:8:6,100 --> 0:8:8,700
of them to you from from Romans 8.

174
0:8:9,800 --> 0:8:12,900
So if we treasure Christ as our only mediator,

175
0:8:13,800 --> 0:8:16,300
we will also treasure the Holy Spirit

176
0:8:16,600 --> 0:8:19,200
as Christ's great gift,

177
0:8:19,200 --> 0:8:21,0
which is inseparable from Him,

178
0:8:22,0 --> 0:8:24,500
to sinners (John 4

179
0:8:25,400 --> 0:8:26,700
and again John 7).

180
0:8:28,100 --> 0:8:29,700
Jonathan Edwards put it this way.

181
0:8:29,900 --> 0:8:33,100
"The sum of the blessings Christ sought

182
0:8:33,700 --> 0:8:35,600
by what he did and suffered

183
0:8:35,600 --> 0:8:37,0
in the work of redemption,

184
0:8:37,900 --> 0:8:39,200
was the Holy Spirit,

185
0:8:40,200 --> 0:8:42,0
the Holy Spirit in His indwelling,

186
0:8:42,400 --> 0:8:44,0
His influences and fruits

187
0:8:44,200 --> 0:8:46,100
is the sum of all grace,

188
0:8:46,300 --> 0:8:47,0
holiness,

189
0:8:47,300 --> 0:8:48,700
comfort and joy,

190
0:8:48,900 --> 0:8:50,0
or in one word

191
0:8:50,0 --> 0:8:52,700
of all the spiritual good Christ purchased

192
0:8:52,700 --> 0:8:54,100
for men in this world.

193
0:8:54,800 --> 0:8:58,0
And is also the sum of all perfection,

194
0:8:58,0 --> 0:8:58,600
glory,

195
0:8:58,600 --> 0:8:59,900
and eternal joy,

196
0:9:0,100 --> 0:9:0,800
that he purchased

197
0:9:0,800 --> 0:9:2,300
for them in another world."

198
0:9:4,500 --> 0:9:7,200
That's an amazing quote by Edwards.

199
0:9:8,400 --> 0:9:9,800
And it certainly shows us

200
0:9:10,500 --> 0:9:13,600
that many today are minimizing

201
0:9:14,300 --> 0:9:15,800
the role of the ministry

202
0:9:16,400 --> 0:9:17,800
of the Holy Spirit as

203
0:9:19,100 --> 0:9:20,900
integral with the entire

204
0:9:21,700 --> 0:9:23,100
sum of blessings

205
0:9:23,100 --> 0:9:26,100
that God's people receive in salvation.

206
0:9:28,800 --> 0:9:30,0
John Brown of Headington

207
0:9:30,900 --> 0:9:31,700
put it this way,

208
0:9:32,400 --> 0:9:34,600
"Did Christ purchase the Holy Spirit?

209
0:9:36,600 --> 0:9:38,700
Christ purchased the Spirit's gifts,

210
0:9:38,700 --> 0:9:42,200
and influences in applying redemption,

211
0:9:42,700 --> 0:9:44,200
but not his being,

212
0:9:45,0 --> 0:9:46,400
which is independent."

213
0:9:47,900 --> 0:9:49,500
So the work of the Spirit

214
0:9:50,500 --> 0:9:51,400
in many ways

215
0:9:51,600 --> 0:9:53,0
is the fruit

216
0:9:53,0 --> 0:9:54,800
of Christ's death and resurrection.

217
0:9:57,0 --> 0:9:57,400
Now,

218
0:9:58,200 --> 0:9:59,400
salvation in Christ

219
0:9:59,400 --> 0:10:1,600
is appreciated and enjoyed therefore

220
0:10:2,200 --> 0:10:4,400
only by knowing the Holy Spirit

221
0:10:4,500 --> 0:10:5,600
and his saving work.

222
0:10:6,700 --> 0:10:8,0
And this is one of the

223
0:10:8,700 --> 0:10:10,900
greatest doctrines of the Reformation,

224
0:10:10,900 --> 0:10:13,600
developed so thoroughly and then even

225
0:10:13,700 --> 0:10:16,300
augmented by the Puritans.

226
0:10:17,100 --> 0:10:22,0
What a treasure Reformed theology brings us

227
0:10:23,400 --> 0:10:26,700
about the saving ministry of the Holy Spirit.

228
0:10:28,300 --> 0:10:29,400
In fact,

229
0:10:29,400 --> 0:10:31,600
BB Warfield called John Calvin

230
0:10:31,900 --> 0:10:35,0
The Theologian of the Holy Spirit.

231
0:10:35,400 --> 0:10:37,0
And Warfield went on to claim

232
0:10:38,0 --> 0:10:39,0
the developed doctrine

233
0:10:39,0 --> 0:10:40,800
of the work of the Holy Spirit

234
0:10:41,200 --> 0:10:43,600
is an exclusively Reformation doctrine,

235
0:10:43,600 --> 0:10:45,700
and more particularly a Reformed doctrine,

236
0:10:45,900 --> 0:10:48,500
and still more particularly a Puritan doctrine.

237
0:10:50,800 --> 0:10:51,400
And so,

238
0:10:52,100 --> 0:10:53,300
study of the Spirit

239
0:10:54,500 --> 0:10:59,0
through Reformed experiential soteriology,

240
0:10:59,400 --> 0:10:59,700
- that is,

241
0:10:59,700 --> 0:11:1,500
salvation that we experience

242
0:11:1,800 --> 0:11:2,400
by the work

243
0:11:2,400 --> 0:11:3,600
of the Spirit in the soul -

244
0:11:4,100 --> 0:11:7,200
opens up a vast wealth of wisdom

245
0:11:7,800 --> 0:11:10,500
and joy to the believer.
