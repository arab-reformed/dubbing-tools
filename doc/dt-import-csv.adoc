= dt-import-csv

import CSV translation data


== Synopsis

    dt-import-csv PROJECT_PATH LANG CSV_FILE


== Description

Imports data that has been previously exported using `dt-export-csv` back into the project.

This operation overwrites the target language translation currently in the project.  Changes to
timings are discarded.

Source changes must consist of moving words between lines.  If source words are moved to a different line then
new times are computed for the phrase and the source phrase updated.

If source words are edited or re-ordered the import will fail.


== Parameters

_project-path_ [str]:: path to the root of the project directory

_lang_ [str]:: target language code to be imported from the CSV file

_csv-file_ [str]:: name of the CSV file
