There are currently three modes of operation supported by the library.

* Subtitling -- subtitles are displayed in the translated language

* Dubbing -- translated audio using TTS.  Since TTS audio can have a different duration than the translated audio, the video is stretched (slowed down) or compressed (sped up) to fit the TTS audio.

* Translation -- Video has both the original language and the translated TTS audio.

NOTE: the video freezes for the translated audio
